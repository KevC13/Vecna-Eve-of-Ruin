# VISIONS

1. See [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) seeking mystical power, becoming an archmage of incredible power, and buiding an alliance the warlord [Kas](<../NPC's/Kas.html>).  Still hungry for power, [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>)  becomes obsessed with artifacts and rituals that would grant him more power and eventually immortality. You see him send Kas to lead his armies, attempting to conquer [Oerth](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Oerth/Oerth.html>), slaughtering thousands, claiming powerful prizes and lost arcane secrets along the way. You see Vecna finally achieve lichdom, transforming from the attractive elven mage he once began as, into a twisted shadow of his former self.

2. Now an immortal archlich, you see [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) twisting the world of [Oerth](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Oerth/Oerth.html>) to his will, building a black rotting tower as his stronghold and waging war against the last desperate nations. Over hundreds of years, you witness his power in the evil arcane arts grow, gathering allies and acolytes to his cause. You see him train and give rise to another lich, you watch [Kas'](<../NPC's/Kas.html>) life extended twisted into a vampire-like form, and finally you see Vecna pouring his malevolent power into the creation of black sword that seems to consume the light around it. This sword he presents to Kas, a reward for the work he has done and a promise of the worlds still left to be conquered.

3. For hundreds of years, [Oerth](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Oerth/Oerth.html>) refuses to fully fall under [Vecna's](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) domination. You feel his furry and frustration, as powerful clerics and mages ally together to contain the evil archlich, nearly defeating him on one occasion. You see Vecna become obsessed with the secrets of the multiverse, and of how to achieve godhood. All the while you see Kas being twisted further by the black blade. The sword manifesting its creators need to dominate. As Vecna stood atop his rotted tower, seeking further power, you watch as Kas, fueled by the black sword's whispers and Kas's own ambition for power, betrayed Vecna by stabbing him with his own sword. The battle between the two that followed was terrible to behold, but in a last desperate act Kas stuck Vecna down stabbing him in the eye, cutting off his left hand, and then finally running him through. The power that was unleashed shattered the Rotting Tower and flung Kas across the multiverse.

4. Hundreds of years pass, with [Vecna's](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) acolytes spreading throughout the planes of existence, establishing cults of worship, hailing his power and his obsession with secrets. You watch as his eye and hand are passed from leader to leader, powerful artifacts still carrying some remnant of Vecna’s power, and imbuing the bearer with the power to dominate the will of monsters, to see into far off places, or even to kill with a single touch.

5. As these cults gained strength, gathering secrets in worship to [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>), you see a swirl of purple energy begin to coalesce in the ethereal plane. Along with power of the eye and hand acting as a link to the evil arcane magic that sustained Vecna, you watch as the twisted form of the archlich solidifies once again, now as a demigod, fueled by the power of secrets.

6. Whether tens or even hundreds of more years have passed, you now witness [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) in the present, fully reborn as a demigod. The sight is familiar to you; you see him once again gathering power from the innumerable cults who are sacrificing the secrets of victims from across the multiverse. You feel his sense of purpose and excitement. The moment is near at hand; the Ritual of Remaking is nearly complete. You see his desire to reshape the multiverse; thousands of deities being destroyed in an instant, worlds reborn in darkness, a shining spire in the center of the Outer Planes being torn down and replaced by the Rotted Tower rebuilt.

7. You first feel rather than see the gathering energy. Like a dam about to break, the power is straining to break free of arcane bonds barely able to contain it. Then you see [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>), surrounded by a crystal cave, stepping forward towards the gathered maelstrom of power and reach towards it, harnessing it… For a moment there is nothing but silence…Then an explosion of energy surges out across the cave, shattering crystal, spreading blackness and rot in its wake. As the destruction reaches the edge of the cave, ready to burst forth across the multiverse, you see dozens and then hundreds of gods, including the [Lady of the Forest](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Lady of the Forest.html>), suddenly appear, summoning their own power in an effort to containing the ritual.
