# Chasm District
Location: [Neverwinter](<./Neverwinter.html>)

Notes: 
- The chasm was once a rift that allowed undead from [Evernight](<../../Shadowfell/Evernight.html>) to pour through, following the eruption of Mount Hotenow.
- When [Lord Neverember](<../../../NPC's/Lord Neverember.html>) took power in [Neverwinter](<./Neverwinter.html>) he conscripted powerful mages to seal the chasm. 
- The Chasm District is now slowly being rebuilt into a local marketplace and living area for the middle class of [Neverwinter](<./Neverwinter.html>)

Key Locations:
- [First Crow Inn](<./First Crow Inn.html>)
