Description: A defiled church that worships the dark god [Orcus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orcus)

Notes:
- [[Sena]] told the [[LightningNuts]] to stay away. The temple is a haven of dangerous and deadly undead who seek to find a way into the Material Plane to find living to devour. 
- Said to be run by a zealot known as the Grand Disciple
- [[Hawk]] used the [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618882-augury) spell to see if it was a good idea to go to the temple and felt the omen of "Woe".
