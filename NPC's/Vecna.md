# Vecna
Role: The Big Bag Villain

Description: A desiccated one-eyed figure adorned in golden armor. His missing eye and one of his hands glows with a magical light.

Notes: 
- Archlich tuned demigod of secrets.
- His cults are gathering powerful secrets for him to empower his "Ritual of Remaking".
- Was once a high elf mage from [Oerth](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Oerth/Oerth.html>)
- Sought more arcane power, and joined forces with a viscous warlord, [Kas](<./Kas.html>).
- Together they conquered all of Oerth and Vecna obtained enough power to transform into an immortal archlich. 
- Still the power was not enough. Vecna and [Kas](<./Kas.html>) set their sights on the multiverse and more powerful magics.
- Vecna crafted the "Sword of Kas", a powerfully evil sword for this warlord, and together they began conquering other realms. 
- As Vecna gathered enough power to ascend to godhood, [Kas](<./Kas.html>) betrayed him, and Vecna was nearly destroyed.
	- Leaving behind only his "Eye" and "Hand"
- It is rumored that over centuries the arcane power that bound him as an archlich began to coalesce once again, and he was restored as the demigod of secrets.
