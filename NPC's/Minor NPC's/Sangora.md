Description: A merchant vampire who operates in the [Corpse Market](<../../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market.html>) of [Evernight](<../../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.html>).

Notes:
- Sells blood along with information.
- Her familiar Marv mans the bloodbar in the [Corpse Market](<../../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market.html>).
- Runs a shop on the edge of the [Corpse Market](<../../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market.html>) called Sangora's Sanguinaries.
- In exchange for 100GP and blood from [Seraphine](<../../PC's/Seraphine.html>), Sangora informed the [LightningNuts](<../../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) of a stable "Crevice of Dusk" portal in the tomb of the Dolindar family.
- Sangora then set a trap for the [LightningNuts](<../../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) at the tomb, sending a few of her vampire spawn take of them. 
- The [LightningNuts](<../../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) easily dealt with the vampire spawn, and [Hawk](<../../PC's/Hawk.html>) sent her newly acquired zombie servant back to assassinate Sangora. (The zombie probably failed).
