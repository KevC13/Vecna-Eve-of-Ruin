# Newmy
Role: Ghost maid in the Dolindar tomb located in [Evernight](<../../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.html>).

Description: A ghost, barely five feet tall, with frizzy blue hair and pale skin shot through with blue veins appears.

Notes: 
- Was paid enough gold by the Dolindar's to keep their tomb clean for centuries.
- Returned as a ghost to continue the job she was paid for. 
- Let the [LightningNuts](<../../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) know that the Dolindar's were exiled and trapped in [Evernight](<../../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.html>) and in their exile became extremely lonely, and eventually turned into sad and frightening monsters.
