Role: Confused Ghost

Notes:
- She roamed the catacombs of the cult hideout in Neverwinter as a faceless ghost who had forgotten her past.
- When her name was finally spoken by the [LightningNuts](<../../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) she regained her true form, that of a female knight, and her memories.
- In gratitude she removed the curse from the [Shield of Missile Attraction](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9814085-shield-of-missile-attraction-uncursed).
