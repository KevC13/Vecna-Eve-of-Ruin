	- **Following another trail, [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.md>) found a locked cell door, and [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.md>) unlocked the door to find [Umberto Noblin](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Umberto Noblin.md>)**
		- **[Umberto Noblin](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Umberto Noblin.md>) was complain about being starved, and so [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.md>) and [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) gained his trust by giving him bread and jerky**
		- **Meanwhile [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>), following the third trail, stumbled upon a lot of cultists and while [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.md>), [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.md>), and [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.md>) ran to aid her in battle, [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) stayed to talk with Umberto**
		- **[Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) learned that [Umberto Noblin](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Umberto Noblin.md>) is a [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>) historian, and he shared his knowledge of how [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>) rose to power**
			- **Long ago [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>) allied himself with a warlord, [Kas](<../NPC's/Kas.md>) the Bloody Handed**
			- **Together they conquered the world of [Oerth](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Oerth/Oerth.md>)**
			- **As [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>) rose to lichdom he created a powerful and evil sword and gave it to [Kas](<../NPC's/Kas.md>)**
			- **But [Kas](<../NPC's/Kas.md>), driven by the power of the sword, betrayed [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>) and tried to destroy him, leaving behind [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>)'s eye and hand.**
			- **[Kas](<../NPC's/Kas.md>) was then flung across the multiverse, losing the sword and becoming trapped in the [Shadowfell](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Shadowfell.md>) world of Tovag, where the Dark Powers waited to use him for their own designs.**
			- **[Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>), supposedly, was reborn as the god of secrets, and his cultists are gathering power for him.**
		- **Hearing this [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) knew this was the powerful [secret](<../SECRETS LEARNED/SECRETS LEARNED.md>) the cult was after.**
		- **After learning this, [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) escorted [Umberto Noblin](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Umberto Noblin.md>) out of the graveyard.**
	- **[Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>), searching alone, stumbled upon several mages and cultists and was soon joined by [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.md>), [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.md>), and [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.md>). Together they wiped them out.**
	- **After the battle, the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) explorer further finding more cultists, some ghouls, large demonic creatures called barlguras, and wraiths. They dealt with these as well**
		- **"Dealt with" included [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>) using Blight to turn a creature to goop, and the demons dissolving into a tar-like substance as they returned to Abyss.**
	- **While the skirmishes were going on, [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) found an empty cell with a notebook detailing the outer planes and areas where the planes converge**
	- **Post battle, [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>) and [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.md>) heard sounds coming from behind another locked door, and [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>) busted down the locked cell door, discovering [Indrina Lamsensettle](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Indrina Lamsensettle.md>) in a foul-smelling room.**
		- **[Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) soon arrived, and bringing Indrina out into cleaner air, she willingly answered any questions asked of her.** 
		- **She was not aware of who [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>), [Kas](<../NPC's/Kas.md>) or the cult was.**
		- **She believed she was kidnapped due to her knowledge that [Lord Neverember](<../NPC's/Lord Neverember.md>) faked his royal lineage and has no claim to the throne**
			- **Hearing this fact the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) knew this was her [secret](<../SECRETS LEARNED/SECRETS LEARNED.md>) that the cult was pursuing.**
			- **[Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.md>) then escorted [Indrina Lamsensettle](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Indrina Lamsensettle.md>) out of the graveyard, asking Indrina about her acting career, and what happened the night she was taken.**
	- **In need of healing, [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) "persuaded" [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>), [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.md>), and [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.md>) to take a "catnap", and after resting the party searched further in the catacombs, looking for the last two victims.**
	- **Khoaz soon stumbled upon the desiccated figure of his brother, [Skaarz](<../NPC's/Skaarz Tarturus.md>), now a victim of the siphon secrets ritual**
		- **[Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.md>) was able to calm him and have him follow the group**
	- **Searching for those responsible, the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) found, overwhelmed and interrogated the cult leader [Jarot](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Jarot.md>).**
		- **[Jarot](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Jarot.md>) told them that he was perfecting the ritual, and tested it on [Skaarz](<../NPC's/Skaarz Tarturus.md>) first**.
		- **He told them that he did not have the power to reverse the process (and wouldn’t even if he did)**
		- **The secrets were being siphoned to empower [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>), and he cackled that they were currently performing the ritual on [Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.md>) in the next room over**
		- **Hearing enough, [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.md>) stuck an arrow through [Jarot](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Jarot.md>)'s eye.
	- **Searching his corpse, [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.md>) found some notes, and learned that he was looking into convergences within the city known as "Crevices of Dusk", and that these would lead to a plane of the undead.**
	- **As the group went to explore further ([Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) in the opposite direction of danger), [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>) turned into a camel and began fleeing with a tapestry of feasting undead on his back, along with [Skaarz](<../NPC's/Skaarz Tarturus.md>) and the body of [Jarot](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Jarot.md>).**
	- **The others soon rushed towards the next room to try to save [Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.md>).   
		- **[Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) hearing the battle down the hall, called out to camel[Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>) and she turned and began galloping back towards the fray, [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) jumping on her back in the process.**
		- **Meanwhile, [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.md>), [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.md>), and [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.md>) found the ritual chamber containing mages and cultists performing the ritual on a caged [Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.md>) and they immediately attacked.**
		- **They were joined shortly by [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>) and [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>), and as the party began killing cultists, the ritual circle began to pulse erratically, until finally when the cult mage was killed it stuttered and went out.**
	- **Moments after the ritual was disrupted, the ritual circle exploded with purplish energy and the party was sucked into a void, seeing visions of [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>) gathering powerful secrets from a multitude of cults around the multiverse.**
		- **This event created a link between the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) and [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.md>) (feat gained) that gave them the power to harness the "secrets" they have heard. **
