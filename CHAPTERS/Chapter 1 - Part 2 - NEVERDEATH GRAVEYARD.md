	- **As the group went to explore further ([[../PC's/Wrick]] in the opposite direction of danger), [[../PC's/Hawk]] turned into a camel and began fleeing with a tapestry of feasting undead on his back, along with [[Skaarz]] and the body of [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Jarot]].**
	- **The others soon rushed towards the next room to try to save [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward]].

		- **They were joined shortly by [[../PC's/Hawk]] and [[../PC's/Wrick]], and as the party began killing cultists, the ritual circle began to pulse erratically, until finally when the cult mage was killed it stuttered and went out.**
	- **Moments after the ritual was disrupted, the ritual circle exploded with purplish energy and the party was sucked into a void, seeing visions of [[../NPC's/Vecna]] gathering powerful secrets from a multitude of cults around the multiverse.**
		- **This event created a link between the [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] and [[../NPC's/Vecna]] (feat gained) that gave them the power to harness the "secrets" they have heard. **
