- [[Wrick]] stole 2 [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) from [[Sena]]

MAJOR PLOT POINTS
- The [[LightningNuts]] were sucked through a temporary "Crevice of Dusk" that opened when the siphon secrets ritual was disrupted, and landed in an open mass grave full of coffins. 
- Freeing [[Eldon Keyward]] from a closed coffin, they soon learned that they had been portaled to the undead city of [[Evernight]], located in the Mirror plane of [[Shadowfell]].
- In [[Eldon Keyward]]'s excitement at being transferred to a new plane of existence, his gleeful screams attracted the attention of some ghouls that were feasting on the corpse of [[Jarot]] nearby, and the [[LightningNuts]] soon found themselves in a battle with the undead. 
- After dispatching the ghouls, [[Khoaz]] found a nearby sheltered area to take a short rest, and then party planned their next move.
	- [[Eldon Keyward]] and [[Khoaz]] new that [[Evernight]] locations will mirror those of [[Neverwinter]].
	- [[Khoaz]] recalled a church, a tavern, and a market all nearby the graveyard in [[Neverwinter]].
		- [[Hawk]] used the [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618882-augury) spell to see if it was a good idea to go to the temple and felt the omen of "Woe"
		- With that knowledge, and in need of a long rest, the [[LightningNuts]] opted to visit the tavern instead.
	- Travelling through [[Evernight]] they found dark and rubble strewn streets, and ran into a harmless zombie carrying a basket of goods to be delivered. 
	- From there the [[LightningNuts]] arrived at what was a warm and inviting tavern, called the [[Smoldering Corpse Tavern]].
		- Inside they found a mixture of living creatures (bandits and vampire familiars), along with undead creatures (zombies, skeletons, and mummies chatting along with some intelligent ghouls playing cards and discussing politics).
		- The owner/bartender [[Sena]] served them drinks and food, and was able to offer room for the night. 
		- From [[Sena]] they learned that;
			- Church to the west was known as the [[Temple of Filth]] and should be avoided, if "you value your lives""
			- The city of [[Evernight]] is run be a ruling council of intelligent ghouls known as the Tribunal.
			- Most of the undead will leave the [[LightningNuts]] alone, assuming they are under the protection of the Tribunal, but if the [[LightningNuts]] cause trouble that protection will not matter. 
			- She did not know any "Crevices of Dusk" locations, as those are rare and typically safely guarded secrets, but a merchant vampire called [[Sangora]] operates out of the [[Corpse Market]] to the southeast, and she deals in information as well as blood. 
		- Having learned what they could the [[LightningNuts]] went to sleep, and in the morning departed for the [[Corpse Market]].
			- As they were saying their goodbyes to [[Sena]], [[Wrick]] snuck into her room and discovered and stole a pair of [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin), and was able to sneak out without being caught.
