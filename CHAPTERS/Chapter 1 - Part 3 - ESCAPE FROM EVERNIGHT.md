# Chapter 1 - Part 3 - ESCAPE FROM EVERNIGHT

## MAGIC ITEMS/TREASURE FOUND
- [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) stole 2 [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) from [Sena](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena.md>)

## MAJOR PLOT POINTS
1. **The [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) were sucked through a temporary "Crevice of Dusk" that opened when the siphon secrets ritual was disrupted, and landed in an open mass grave full of coffins.** 
2. **Freeing [Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.md>) from a closed coffin, they soon learned that they had been portaled to the undead city of [Evernight](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.md>), located in the Mirror plane of [Shadowfell](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Shadowfell.md>).**
3. **In [Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.md>)'s excitement at being transferred to a new plane of existence, his gleeful screams attracted the attention of some ghouls that were feasting on the corpse of [Jarot](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Jarot.md>) nearby, and the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) soon found themselves in a battle with the undead.** 
4. **After dispatching the ghouls, [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.md>) found a nearby sheltered area to take a short rest, and then party planned their next move.**
	- **[Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.md>) and [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.md>) new that [Evernight](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.md>) locations will mirror those of [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.md>).**
	- **[Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.md>) recalled a church, a tavern, and a market all nearby the graveyard in [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.md>).**
		- **[Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>) used the [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618882-augury) spell to see if it was a good idea to go to the temple and felt the omen of "Woe".**
		- **With that knowledge, and in need of a long rest, the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) opted to visit the tavern instead.**
	- **Travelling through [Evernight](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.md>) they found dark and rubble strewn streets, and ran into a harmless zombie carrying a basket of goods to be delivered.** 
	- **From there the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) arrived at what was a warm and inviting tavern, called the [Smoldering Corpse Tavern](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Smoldering Corpse Tavern.md>).**
		- **Inside they found a mixture of living creatures (bandits and vampire familiars), along with undead creatures (zombies, skeletons, and mummies chatting along with some intelligent ghouls playing cards and discussing politics).
		- **The owner/bartender [Sena](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena.md>) served them drinks and food, and was able to offer room for the night.** 
		- **From [Sena](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena.md>) they learned that;**
			- **Church to the west was known as the [Temple of Filth](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Temple of Filth.md>) and should be avoided, if "you value your lives"**
			- **The city of [Evernight](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.md>) is run be a ruling council of intelligent ghouls known as the Tribunal.**
			- **Most of the undead will leave the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) alone, assuming they are under the protection of the Tribunal, but if the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) cause trouble that protection will not matter.**
			- **She did not know any "Crevices of Dusk" locations, as those are rare and typically safely guarded secrets, but a merchant vampire called [Sangora](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sangora.md>) operates out of the [Corpse Market](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market.md>) to the southeast, and she deals in information as well as blood.**
		- **Having learned what they could the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) went to sleep, and in the morning departed for the [Corpse Market](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market.md>).**
			- **As they were saying their goodbyes to [Sena](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena.md>), [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.md>) snuck into her room and discovered and stole a pair of [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin), and was able to sneak out without being caught.**
5.  **The [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.md>) arrived at the corpse market to find vendors hocking a variety of strange wares; dead flowers, body parts, warm blood, old jewelry, and more.**
	- [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.md>) loved the atmosphere of the market, deciding to partake in some bat wings, buyin a jar of brains, and a cheap gold-ish collar.
	- [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>) as well appreciated the strange items for sale, buying some dried lavender for [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.md>), some dried sage for herself, and even buying an undead servant zombie.
