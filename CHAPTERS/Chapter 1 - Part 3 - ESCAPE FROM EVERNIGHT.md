# Chapter 1 - Part 3 - ESCAPE FROM EVERNIGHT

## MAGIC ITEMS/TREASURE FOUND
- [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.html>) stole 2 [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin) from [Sena](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena.html>)

## MAJOR PLOT POINTS
1. **The [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) were sucked through a temporary "Crevice of Dusk" that opened when the siphon secrets ritual was disrupted, and landed in an open mass grave full of coffins.** 
2. **Freeing [Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.html>) from a closed coffin, they soon learned that they had been portaled to the undead city of [Evernight](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.html>), located in the Mirror plane of [Shadowfell](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Shadowfell.html>).**
3. **In [Eldon Keyward's](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.html>) excitement at being transferred to a new plane of existence, his gleeful screams attracted the attention of some ghouls that were feasting on the corpse of [Jarot](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Jarot.html>) nearby, and the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) soon found themselves in a battle with the undead.** 
4. **After dispatching the ghouls, [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.html>) found a nearby sheltered area to take a short rest, and then party planned their next move.**
	- **[Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.html>) and [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.html>) new that [Evernight](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.html>) locations will mirror those of [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.html>).**
	- **[Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.html>) recalled a church, a tavern, and a market all nearby the graveyard in [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.html>).**
		- **[Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>) used the [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618882-augury) spell to see if it was a good idea to go to the temple and felt the omen of "Woe".**
		- **With that knowledge, and in need of a long rest, the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) opted to visit the tavern instead.**
	- **Travelling through [Evernight](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.html>) they found dark and rubble strewn streets, and ran into a harmless zombie carrying a basket of goods to be delivered.** 
	- **From there the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) arrived at what was a warm and inviting tavern, called the [Smoldering Corpse Tavern](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Smoldering Corpse Tavern.html>).**
		- **Inside they found a mixture of living creatures (bandits and vampire familiars), along with undead creatures (zombies, skeletons, and mummies chatting along with some intelligent ghouls playing cards and discussing politics).**
		- **The owner/bartender [Sena](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena.html>) served them drinks and food, and was able to offer room for the night.** 
		- **From [Sena](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena.html>) they learned that;**
			- **Church to the west was known as the [Temple of Filth](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Temple of Filth.html>) and should be avoided, if "you value your lives"**
			- **The city of [Evernight](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.html>) is run by a ruling council of intelligent ghouls known as the Tribunal.**
			- **Most of the undead will leave the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) alone, assuming they are under the protection of the Tribunal, but if the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) cause trouble that protection will not matter.**
			- **She did not know any "Crevices of Dusk" locations, as those are rare and typically safely guarded secrets, but a merchant vampire called [Sangora](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sangora.html>) operates out of the [Corpse Market](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market.html>) to the southeast, and she deals in information as well as blood.**
		- **Having learned what they could the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) went to sleep, and in the morning departed for the [Corpse Market](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market.html>).**
			- **As they were saying their goodbyes to [Sena](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena.html>), [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.html>) snuck into her room and discovered and stole a pair of [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin), and was able to sneak out without being caught.**
5.  **The [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) arrived at the [Corpse Market](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market.html>) to find vendors hocking a variety of strange wares; dead flowers, body parts, warm blood, old jewelry, and more.**
	- **[Roman](<../PC's/Roman.html>) loved the atmosphere of the market, deciding to partake in some bat wings, buying a jar of brains, and a cheap gold-ish collar.**
	- **[Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>) as well appreciated the strange items for sale, buying a dried orchid flower for [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.html>), to add to her bundle of lavender. Additionally [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>) bought some dried sage for herself, along with an undead servant zombie.**
	- **[Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.html>), however, was focused entirely on getting the hell out of the dangerous citry of the undead, and went to seek out [Sangora](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sangora.html>).** 
		- **He soon found her at a shop on the edge of the [Corpse Market](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market.html>) called Sangora's Sanguinaries, and cutting to the chase inquired about information regarding her knowledge of "crevices".
		- **[Sangora](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sangora.html>) told him that the information regarding a portal out of the city would cost 500gp or a bottle of [Seraphine's](<../PC's/Seraphine.html>) blood.** 
		- **Willing to take one for the team, [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.html>) agreed to offer up her blood.**
		- **True to her word, [Sangora](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sangora.html>) let the party know that there was a stable portal in the tomb of the Dolindar family in [Evernight's](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.html>) graveyard.**
6. **When arriving at the Dolindar tomb the [LightningNuts](<../../PC's/LightningNuts.html>), however, found that [Sangora](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sangora.html>) had set up an ambush, sending a few of her vampire spawn to take care of them.**
	- **Not deterred, the [LightningNuts](<../../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) easily dealt with the vampire spawn, and [Hawk](<../../PC's/Hawk.html>) sent her newly acquired zombie servant back to assassinate [Sangora](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sangora.html>). (The zombie probably failed).**
	- **Entering the Dolindar tomb, the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) encountered a friendly and enthusiastic ghost [Newmy](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Newmy.html>) who was paid to keep the tomb clean for centuries. She enjoyed the work so much that she decided to keep cleaning even after her death.**
	- **[Newmy](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Newmy.html>) informed the [LightningNuts](<../../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) that the Dolindar's were exiled and trapped in [Evernight](<../../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight.html>) and in their exile became extremely lonely, and eventually turned into sad and frightening monsters.**
	- **Exploring further the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) encountered two of the Dolindar's, now transformed into hideous monsters, called sorrowsworn, and [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.html>) soon found himself grappled and pierced by their blade-like arms, taking psychic damage from contact with the despair laden creatures. Rallying the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) were able to vanquish the monsters.**
	- **In the adjoining rooms, the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) found a door locked by a word puzzle and a room filled with various treasure items.**
		- [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.html>) quickly stashed a pile of 2,200GP.
		- [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.html>) took a small snow globe with an intricate model of [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.html>) inside (worth 350GP).
		- [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.html>) took an adorned a golden helmet (worth 280GP) along with a [driftglobe](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9228521-driftglobe) that has a map of the gate towns of the Outlands carved on it.
		- [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>) snagged a [necklace of adaptation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4682-necklace-of-adaptation).
		- [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.html>) took a book titledÂ _Out of the Endless Prison_, outlining methods of escaping the prison-plane of [Carceri](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Carceri) (worth 500GP) which [Eldon](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.html>) eagerly wants to buy when they return to [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.html>).
	- **Moving on to study the puzzle, [Wrick](<../PC's/Wrick.html>), along with clues discovered by [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>) about the Dolindar's, determined that pressing the letters in each word that spell out ALONE would open the door.**
	- **Beyond the door they found the Dolindar matriarch, also transformed into a monstrous sorrowsworn.** 
	- **Vanquishing her, they discovered a portal inside her coffin and jumping through were teleported back to [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.html>).**
	- **During their travel through the portal the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) saw another vision, this time of [Vecna's](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) rise to power, along with [Kas](<../NPC's/Kas.html>). The vision followed the history that [Umberto Noblin](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Umberto Noblin.html>) outlined, but this time the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) not only saw [Vecna's](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) rise to power with their own eyes, but also felt his insatiable hunger for power.** 
7. **Finally returned to [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.html>) the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) made their way back to [Lord Neverember](<../NPC's/Lord Neverember.html>) to relay all that they had learned, and found the leader relieved and incredibly grateful. He presented gifts of gold and an fully furnished villa for the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) and informed them that cult of [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) has fled from [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.html>) entirely.**
8. **Over the course of the next week, the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) found time to relax, to shop, to research areas of interest, and true to form to also create some trouble as well.**
	- **[Roman](<../PC's/Roman.html>) spent his downtime testing his might in the Fighting Pits of [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.html>). While he was able to win his initial introductory fight easily, he found the competition in the "contenders" arenas much more difficult, losing his next two bouts. [Roman's](<../PC's/Roman.html>) consolation prize was 100GP of winnings and an alchemy jug full of ale.**
	- **[Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.html>) spent her time in Hall of Knowledge, the famed library and temple, located in the heat of [Neverwinter](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter.html>). There she spent hours on end researching what ill could be done to her with the blood she gave to the vampire [Sangora](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sangora.html>).**
	- **[Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>) embarked on a reckless quest for magical items, searching out vendors with links to very rare items. One such vendor, Callum's Curios, possessed a pink and green [Iuon Stone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9228804-ioun-stone).
