MAJOR PLOT POINTS
- The [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] were sucked through a temporary "Crevice of Dusk" that opened when the siphon secrets ritual was disrupted, and landed in an open mass grave full of coffins. 
- Freeing [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward]] from a closed coffin, they soon learned that they had been portaled to the undead city of [[../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight]], located in the Mirror plane of [[../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Shadowfell]].
- In [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward]]'s excitement at being transferred to a new plane of existence, his gleeful screams attracted the attention of some ghouls that were feasting on the corpse of [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Jarot]] nearby, and the [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] soon found themselves in a battle with the undead. 
- After dispatching the ghouls, [[../PC's/Khoaz]] found a nearby sheltered area to take a short rest, and then party planned their next move.
	- [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward]] and [[../PC's/Khoaz]] new that [[../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight]] locations will mirror those of [[../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter]].
	- [[../PC's/Khoaz]] recalled a church, a tavern, and a market all nearby the graveyard in [[../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Neverwinter]].
		- [[../PC's/Hawk]] used the [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618882-augury) spell to see if it was a good idea to go to the temple and felt the omen of "Woe"
		- With that knowledge, and in need of a long rest, the [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] opted to visit the tavern instead.
	- Travelling through [[../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight]] they found dark and rubble strewn streets, and ran into a harmless zombie carrying a basket of goods to be delivered. 
	- From there the [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] arrived at what was a warm and inviting tavern, called the [[../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Smoldering Corpse Tavern]].
		- Inside they found a mixture of living creatures (bandits and vampire familiars), along with undead creatures (zombies, skeletons, and mummies chatting along with some intelligent ghouls playing cards and discussing politics).
		- The owner/bartender [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena]] served them drinks and food, and was able to offer room for the night. 
		- From [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena]] they learned that;
			- Church to the west was known as the [[../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Temple of Filth]] and should be avoided, if "you value your lives""
			- The city of [[../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Evernight]] is run be a ruling council of intelligent ghouls known as the Tribunal.
			- Most of the undead will leave the [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] alone, assuming they are under the protection of the Tribunal, but if the [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] cause trouble that protection will not matter. 
			- She did not know any "Crevices of Dusk" locations, as those are rare and typically safely guarded secrets, but a merchant vampire called [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sangora]] operates out of the [[../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market]] to the southeast, and she deals in information as well as blood. 
		- Having learned what they could the [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] went to sleep, and in the morning departed for the [[../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Corpse Market]].
			- As they were saying their goodbyes to [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sena]], [[../PC's/Wrick]] snuck into her room and discovered and stole a pair of [soul coins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/842308-soul-coin), and was able to sneak out without being caught.
