## MAJOR PLOT POINTS
1. **Entering the portal, followed by [Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.html>), the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) found themselves transported to a beautiful Sanctum in the city of [Sigil](<../LOCATIONS/Sigil.html>). When they arrived they were greeted by three of the most powerful archmagi in history, [Lady Alustriel Silverhand](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>), [Tasha](<../NPC's/Tasha.html>), and [Mordenkainen](<../NPC's/Mordenkainen.html>).**
	-  **[Alustriel](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>) informed them that hours ago [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) completed his Ritual of Remaking, beginning to unravel the multiverse, but hundreds of gods stepped into contain the unleashed destructive power.** 
	-  **[Alustriel](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>) went on describe how her mother, the goddess [Mystra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mystra), urged the Wizard's Three to create a link with [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>), and that only through a link to his power would it be possible to reverse the Ritual and stop the destruction.**
	- **The Wizard's Three created a [Wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619213-wish) spell, in an attempt to establish the link, but instead it created a portal summoning the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) to the Sanctum due to the link that they already shared to [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>).**
