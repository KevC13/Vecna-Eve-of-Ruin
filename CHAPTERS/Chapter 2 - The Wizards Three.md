- [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.html>) picked up some [Boots of Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4589-boots-of-speed) from [Alustriel's](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>) Sanctum on [Sigil](<../LOCATIONS/Sigil.html>) and placed them in his Bag of Holding.

## MAJOR PLOT POINTS
1. **Entering the portal, followed by [Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.html>), the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) found themselves transported to a beautiful Sanctum in the city of [Sigil](<../LOCATIONS/Sigil.html>). When they arrived they were greeted by three of the most powerful archmagi in history, [Lady Alustriel Silverhand](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>), [Tasha](<../NPC's/Tasha.html>), and [Mordenkainen](<../NPC's/Mordenkainen.html>).**
	-  **[Alustriel](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>) informed them that hours ago [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) completed his Ritual of Remaking, beginning to unravel the multiverse, but hundreds of gods stepped into contain the unleashed destructive power.** 
	-  **[Alustriel](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>) went on describe how her mother, the goddess [Mystra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mystra), urged the Wizard's Three to create a link with [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>), and that only through a link to his power would it be possible to reverse the Ritual and stop the destruction.**
	- **The Wizard's Three created a [Wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619213-wish) spell, in an attempt to establish the link, but instead it created a portal summoning the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) to the Sanctum due to the link that they already shared to [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>).**
2. **With the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) link to [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) the next task was to determine how to use that link to reverse the Ritual and stop [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>).**
	- While [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.html>) and [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.html>) rested, [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.html>) joined [Mordenkainen](<../NPC's/Mordenkainen.html>) and [Eldon](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.html>) in researching magic items and means for stopping the Ritual. After a couple of hours, the three found that an ancient artifact known as the [Rod of Law](<../SECRETS LEARNED/Rod of Seven Parts.html>) has the ability to reverse the Ritual of Remaking by restoring law and order to the multiverse. The Rod, however was broken in to seven pieces, and is now commonly referred as the [Rod of Seven Parts](<../SECRETS LEARNED/Rod of Seven Parts.html>). Researching further, they found the account of a [Lolth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lolth) cult leader using a piece of the Rod to commune with the Demon Queen of Spiders during the destruction of [Ched Nasad](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ched_Nasad), and traced its location to a hidden cult lair just outside the ruins of [Ched Nasad](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ched_Nasad).
