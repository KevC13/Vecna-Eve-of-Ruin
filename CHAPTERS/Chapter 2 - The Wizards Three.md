- [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.html>) picked up some [Boots of Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4589-boots-of-speed) from [Alustriel's](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>) Sanctum on [Sigil](<../LOCATIONS/Sigil.html>) and placed them in his Bag of Holding.

## MAJOR PLOT POINTS
1. **Entering the portal, followed by [Eldon Keyward](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.html>), the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) found themselves transported to a beautiful Sanctum in the city of [Sigil](<../LOCATIONS/Sigil.html>). When they arrived they were greeted by three of the most powerful archmagi in history, [Lady Alustriel Silverhand](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>), [Tasha](<../NPC's/Tasha.html>), and [Mordenkainen](<../NPC's/Mordenkainen.html>).**
	-  [Alustriel](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>) informed them that hours ago [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) completed his Ritual of Remaking, beginning to unravel the multiverse, but hundreds of gods stepped into contain the unleashed destructive power. 
	-  [Alustriel](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>) went on describe how her mother, the goddess [Mystra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mystra), urged the Wizard's Three to create a link with [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>), and that only through a link to his power would it be possible to reverse the Ritual and stop the destruction.
	- The Wizard's Three created a [Wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619213-wish) spell, in an attempt to establish the link, but instead it created a portal summoning the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) to the Sanctum due to the link that they already shared to [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>).
2. **With the [LightningNuts](<../PC's/LightningNuts.html>) link to [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) the next task was to determine how to use that link to reverse the Ritual and stop [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>).**
	- While [Roman](<../PC's/Roman.html>) and [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.html>) rested, [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.html>) joined [Mordenkainen](<../NPC's/Mordenkainen.html>) and [Eldon](<../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward.html>) in researching magic items and means for stopping the Ritual. After a couple of hours, the three found that an ancient artifact known as the [Rod of Law](<../SECRETS LEARNED/Rod of Seven Parts.html>) has the ability to reverse the Ritual of Remaking by restoring law and order to the multiverse. The Rod, however was broken in to seven pieces, and is now commonly referred as the [Rod of Seven Parts](<../SECRETS LEARNED/Rod of Seven Parts.html>). Researching further, they found the account of a [Lolth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lolth) cult leader using a piece of the Rod to commune with the Demon Queen of Spiders during the destruction of [Ched Nasad](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ched_Nasad), and traced its location to a hidden cult lair just outside the ruins of [Ched Nasad](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ched_Nasad).
		- The cult leader mentioned that "only through the eyes of those most faithful to the Spider Queen" can the path to the lair be found. 
	- Their research also determined that two magical objects were capable of stopping [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) himself. The first is the infamous Sword of Kas, which has the ability to destroy [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>), but has been lost since [Kas'](<../NPC's/Kas.html>) betrayal. The second item is known as the [Chime of Exile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8419439-chime-of-exile), which can banish [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) to [Oerth](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Oerth/Oerth.html>) once he is sufficiently weakened, and is currently in the Sanctum of [Alustriel Silverhand](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>). 
		- Learning of the Chime's power, [Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.html>) took charge of that magic item so she could "jingle the bells".
3. **[Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>), however, used her time in the Sanctum to further understand the shadow she unleashed in [Oerth](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Oerth/Oerth.html>), and why she was seeing this shadow watching her at times at the periphery of her vision.** 
	- Knowing of [Tasha's](<../NPC's/Tasha.html>) ties to [Oerth](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Oerth/Oerth.html>) and her renown as a demonologist, [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>) sought the witch out. 
	- At first the witch had little insight to offer [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>), but after taking some time to ponder the problem, [Tasha](<../NPC's/Tasha.html>) suggested that they perform a seance-like ritual to explore the connection of the shadow to [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>).
	- As [Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>) drifted into a trance, she found herself reliving the day she released the shadow into the world. Once again she watched the shadow claw its way out of the dark portal she had opened, but this time, in the last instant before the claws of the shadow would render her sightless, she saw the formless dark take shape and recognized the face of the shadow as that of [Kas the Bloody Handed](<../NPC's/Kas.html>), now free of his [Shadowfell](<../LOCATIONS/Shadowfell/Shadowfell.html>) prison.
4. **With a clue to the location of first piece of the Rod, and a few new magic items, the group traveled, via a portal opened by [Alustriel](<../NPC's/Alustriel Silverhand.html>) in the Sanctum, to the [Underdark](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Underdark) on the outskirts of the ruined city of  [Ched Nasad](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ched_Nasad).**
	- Arriving they discovered a network of dark tunnels, faintly illuminated by glowing lichen. Searching they stumbled upon the remnants of caravan that had been attacked, and began following the trail of a large body being dragged deeper into the tunnels by a couple of footprints, one set belonging to a hobgoblin and the other by a duergar.
