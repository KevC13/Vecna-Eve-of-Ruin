## MAJOR PLOT POINTS
1. **Spoke with [Lord Neverember](../NPC'S/Lord Neverember.md)  (paid them 300GP each) who asked them to investigate the cult**

 2.  **Spoke with [Kevori](<../NPC's/Kevori.md>) (joined the party for the mission)**

3.  **Inspected the body and determined the man died by unknown magical means**

4.  **[Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.md>) stuck the eye in her socket - activated the eye. The eye then became a compass pointing towards the cult hideout in the [[../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Chasm District]]**
	- **[[../PC's/Hawk]] later removed the eye to open the cult hideout door**

5.  **The [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] then followed the eye/compass to a network of catacombs and eventually unlocked the cult hideout.**

6. **While exploring [[../PC's/Roman]] found a cursed [Shield of Missile Attraction](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9814085-shield-of-missile-attraction-uncursed)  
	- **The [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] later learned the identity of a confused ghost, [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Chanelle Hallwinter]], and in gratitude she removed the curse.**
		- **[[../PC's/Khoaz]] recognized the crest on the tomb of the Knight as the Hallwinter Family**
		- **[[../PC's/Khoaz]] also found/opened the gold locket with Chanelle's name on it.**


7.  **[[../PC's/Seraphine]] recognized the eye in the palm of a hand as the symbol of the demi-god/lich [[../NPC's/Vecna]], the fearsome god of secrets.**

8.  **[[../PC's/Roman]] and [[../PC's/Khoaz]] found and read the cult mages notes**
	- **The mage had discovered how to siphon secrets to send to [[../NPC's/Vecna]] for his Ritual of Remaking**
	- **Tested the process of siphoning secrets on a traitor, [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Raina]], and sent the details to other cult leaders**
	- **Mage identified some targets with powerful secrets for leader Jarot in Neverwinter**
		- [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Eldon Keyward]], [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Indrina Lamsensettle]], [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Sarcelle Malinosh]], [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Umberto Noblin]], [[../NPC's/Skaarz Tarturus]]
	- **Mentioned other cult sects throughout the multiverse**

9.  **[[../PC's/Wrick]] landed his first "bitch slap" of the campaign on the cult mage**

10.  **[[../PC's/Seraphine]] and [[../PC's/Hawk]] determined that the victim of the ritual to siphon secrets, [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Raina]], has been drained and turned undead. Only a spell of "[True Resurrection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619199-true-resurrection)" can restore her.**

11.  **The [[../PC's/LightningNuts]] brought [[../NPC's/Minor NPC's/Raina]] with them to [[../NPC's/Lord Neverember]] who took her in and will have his servants look after her.**
