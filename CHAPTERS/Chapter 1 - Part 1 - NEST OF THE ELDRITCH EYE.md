3.  **Inspected the body and determined the man died by unknown magical means**

4.  **[Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>) stuck the eye in her socket - activated the eye. The eye then became a compass pointing towards the cult hideout in the [Chasm District](<../LOCATIONS/Material Plane/Faerun/Chasm District.html>)**
	- **[Hawk](<../PC's/Hawk.html>) later removed the eye to open the cult hideout door**

		- **[Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.html>) recognized the crest on the tomb of the Knight as the Hallwinter Family**
		- **[Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.html>) also found/opened the gold locket with Chanelle's name on it.**


7.  **[Seraphine](<../PC's/Seraphine.html>) recognized the eye in the palm of a hand as the symbol of the demi-god/lich [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>), the fearsome god of secrets.**

8.  **[Roman](<../PC's/Roman.html>) and [Khoaz](<../PC's/Khoaz.html>) found and read the cult mages notes**
	- **The mage had discovered how to siphon secrets to send to [Vecna](<../NPC's/Vecna.html>) for his Ritual of Remaking**
